<h1>
    Is an Activist’s Pricey House News? Facebook Alone Decides.
</h1>
<h4>

<p>
    If the article shows your home or apartment, says what city you’re in and you don’t like it, you can complain to Facebook. Facebook will then ensure that nobody can share the article on its giant platform and, as a bonus, block you from sending it to
    anyone in Facebook Messenger.

    I learned this rule from a cheerfully intense senior Facebook lawyer. The lawyer, who was supplied by Facebook’s public relations department on the condition she could speak only anonymously to discuss a specific case, was trying to explain why the service
    had expunged a meanspirited New York Post article about a Black Lives Matter activist’s real estate purchases.
